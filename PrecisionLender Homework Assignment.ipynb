    "In my opinion, the assignment was a reasonable assessment of my ability to understand the nature of the task, do independent research, and handle ambiguity when acquiring and analyzing public data. Here are some things I might do differently if I were designing the task:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Provide additional context:__ It might be beneficial to provide some basic links other than the FFIEC data for the interviewee to get started on this assignment. I am not a domain-expert in commercial banking products (yet!) and it took me a non-trivial amount of time to do the basic research needed to get started on the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Provide anonymized transactional data:__ I think it could be interesting and insightful to provide the interviewee with some anonymized transactional banking data with two separate tasks. For instance, Lending Club provides its [complete set of anoymized loan data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). One task could be to perform a specific analysis with the data set (Example: calculate and visualize the loan-to-value ratio for real estate loans from a given set of banks), and the other task could be a more ambiguous, and open-ended question like the original task for this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Demonstrate quantitative analysis and/or visualization:__ Ask the interviewee to demonstrate a piece of their analysis using  analytical software of their choice (Python, R, Tableau, Excel, etc.) to assess their competence in at least one tool, and their ability to present and communicate their results."
